Le Sage's push gravity mechanism (1690) proposed that 
gravitational attraction emerges from external pressure 
rather than intrinsic curvature. Poincaré correctly 
refuted his implementation—discrete particles colliding 
generate infinite heat—but physics discarded the entire 
framework rather than correcting the error. We propose 
that Le Sage's core insight was correct: gravity IS 
external pressure. His categorical error was using 
discrete collisions rather than continuous pressure 
gradients in the eCEL framework (coupled Electric Charge, 
Liberated). This correction resolves Poincaré's 
thermodynamic objection while maintaining Le Sage's 
mechanical explanation. The 1919 eclipse deflection 
(1.75 arcsec) emerges naturally from eCEL density 
gradients via refraction rather than spacetime curvature. 
Critically, eCEL predicts differential lensing between 
old and young stars of equal mass—directly testable 
with existing telescopes.
