ENERGY FROM eCEL DEFORMATION, NOT MASS CONVERSION: RESOLVING THE E=mc² PARADOX

ABSTRACT
Einstein's iconic equation E=mc² suggests that energy originates from mass conversion. However, this interpretation faces a fundamental paradox: hydrogen bombs (lighter fuel) consistently release more energy than uranium bombs (heavier fuel), directly contradicting the premise that greater mass yields greater energy. We propose that energy liberation arises not from mass annihilation but from deformation and rupture of the eCEL framework—coupled Electric Charge, Liberated—which operates in multiple modes including lattice configurations. In this framework: (1) fission separates eCEL nodes, releasing stored elastic tension; (2) fusion ruptures eCEL connectivity, creating temporary void-flow gradients; (3) the magnitude of energy release depends on eCEL geometry and tension distribution rather than raw mass content.
Recent NASA experiments on Lattice Confinement Fusion (LCF) inadvertently validate this mechanism, demonstrating enhancement factors of 10⁴⁰ through metallic screening—an effect inexplicable within standard quantum mechanics but naturally emergent in eCEL dynamics operating in lattice mode. This work rehabilitates the historically rejected pressure-gradient mechanism of Fatio de Duillier and Georges-Louis Le Sage (1690-1784), correcting their fatal error: gravitational attraction emerges not from discrete particle collisions (which violate thermodynamics) but from continuous pressure gradients in the eCEL framework operating in its ocean mode (Modo 10).
Einstein's field equations remain valid as phenomenological descriptions, but their solutions must be reinterpreted: curved spacetime represents accumulated eCEL material patterns rather than intrinsic geometric properties. This reinterpretation resolves the galaxy rotation curve problem (so-called "dark matter") as a retention effect arising from accumulated eCEL material forming two distinct structures: filamentary chains (Modo 7, cosmic web) and toroidal envelopes (Modo 8, Cuantic Belt) around galaxies—physical eCEL configurations transparent to light but mechanically interactive.
We present seven falsifiable predictions within the S.O.S-10 framework (Save Our Science - 10 operational modes), including: (1) differential gravitational lensing between old and young stars of identical mass, testable with existing telescopes; (2) material-dependent fusion rates, already observed in NASA LCF experiments; (3) chromatic cosmic rainbow effects in gamma-ray bursts, observed by Fermi-LAT and currently misattributed to quantum gravity effects.
Historical critiques of Einstein's E=mc² derivation (Ives 1952, Jammer 1961, Ohanian 2009) identified circular reasoning in the mass-energy equivalence proof. The eCEL-MOD10 framework resolves this circularity by grounding energy in a mechanical substrate—eCEL deformation across its operational modes—rather than abstract mass-energy convertibility. By correcting Le Sage's categorical error (collision → pressure) and extending it through 10 operational modes, we reopen a conceptually fertile pathway across scales, from nuclear physics to cosmology, unified by a single mechanical principle.
